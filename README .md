# Titanic Survival Prediction - codsoft internship task

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It uses passenger information such as age, sex, passenger class, and others to make predictions.


## Features

- Data preprocessing using sklearn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer
- Logistic Regression model for prediction
- Interactive command-line interface for user input
- Probability-based survival predictions



## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
##  Installation

-  Clone this repository: https://github.com/arsha-ai/TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION-CODSOFT-INTERNSHIP-TASK.git
